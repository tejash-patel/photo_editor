# photo_editor 
> *The code adheres to widely-used Python coding and documentation conventions.
The app provided hands-on experience developing a small-scale, interactive program that is partitioned into multiple module*

The photo-editing app is structured as three modules: 
1. Cimpl.py, 
2. photo_filters.py *(which contains the different filters functions)* and 
3. user_interface.py *(which contains the user-interface code for the app)*. 

To test it launch the user_interface.py file in a python shell. Type L to upload an image. It will preview the image, close the preview pop-up window to continue further. Type the first letter of filter you want to apply on it. For example type S to solarise it. Finally, type Q to quit the app when you are done.
